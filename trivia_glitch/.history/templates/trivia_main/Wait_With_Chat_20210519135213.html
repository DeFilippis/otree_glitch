        Please wait while your partner submits their answer. Feel free to chat in the meantime. If you see this wait page for more than 5 minutes, please contact the project manager at defilippis@gmail.com. It is likely that your partner has exited the experiment. In the meantime, feel free to chat with your partner while they complete the previous page.
