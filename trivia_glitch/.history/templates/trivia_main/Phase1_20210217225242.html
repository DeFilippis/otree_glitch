<h1>Welcome to Phase</h1>
<h2>Rules of the Game</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>You and your partner will answer trivia questions together using a chat platform.
        <li>You can only score points if you select the right answer, and you and your partner select the same agreed-upon, "joint" answer</li>
        <li>You lose points every time you get a joint answer wrong, or if you fail to agree with your partner. Every correct answer in this round is worth ${{Constants.BONUS_VALUE_ONE}}</li>
        <li>For every question, you will first be required to answer the question privately, without access to a chat box. Then, you will be required to chat with your partner to agree upon a single, "joint" answer.
        <li>Please do not exit the browser or leave the game. This will invalidate the study, cause your partner to get stuck in a waiting loop, and result in forfeiture of payment.</li>
        <li>Cheating is strictly prohibited.  Multiple measures are in place to detect cheating: your results and bonus payments will be void if cheating detected.</li>
        <li>There will be three phases of quizzes.  Phase 1 will contain {{len_q1}} questions.  Phase 2 will contain {{len_q2}} questions.  Phase 3 will contain {{len_q3}} questions.</li>

        <li>Good luck!</li> 
    </ul>
