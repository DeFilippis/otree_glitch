    <ul>
        <li>Read this quickly. DO NOT let this page time out, as doing so can result in you and your partner getting stuck in a wait page. Press Next before the timer runs out</li>
        <li>PLEASE NOTE: Failure to answer two questions in a row within the time limit will result in you being automatically kicked from the study.
        <li> You have entered the third and final phase of the game. You will now be asked to answer {{Constants.PHASE_3_LENGTH}} trivia questions. These questions are now worth ${{Constants.BONUS_VALUE_TWO}} each, and will be substantially harder than the first round.
        <li> Please make sure you are registering your confidence in each answer as accurately as possible.</li>
    </ul>

        PLEASE READ: None of the questions in Phase 3 are "trick" questions -- the answers are supported by verifiable facts from numerous sources. There is no deception involved in this study.
